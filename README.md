# Aritha Security
 A high-performance home surveillance video processing and streaming solution designed for seamless encoding, decoding, and real-time streaming of video content. It leverages FFmpeg,  of which is a widely-used multimedia framework, and uses advanced C++ techniques to ensure reliability and scalability. Below is a detailed high-level overview.

 # Idea switch 
 At first I wanted to create a just library but I will develop a high performance home suiveilance pipeline to demontrate. 

 # Dynamic architecture

 ### Applications
- Live Streaming:
- Broadcasting live events (e.g., concerts, sports).
- Real-time video surveillance systems.
- Video Transcoding:
- Converting video formats (e.g., H.265 to H.264).
- Optimizing video files for web delivery.
- Edge Devices:
- Streaming from low-powered devices like IoT cameras or embedded systems.
- Media Servers:
- Integrating with media servers like GStreamer or custom-built streaming platforms.

## Pipeline flow 

``` c
VideoCapture
   (decodes frames)
        ↓
MotionDetector
   (simple or skip altogether)
        ↓
AIDetector
   (advanced object detection, classification, or custom AI logic)
        ↓
VideoEncoder
   (encodes frames)
        ↓
VideoStreamer
   (streams out RTMP, etc.)
```


## Advantages Overview

Built upon performance-Oriented:
Optimized for low-latency real-time applications.
Supports hardware acceleration (e.g., NVIDIA GPU) with minor modifications.
Extensibility:
Additional features (e.g., overlays, watermarking, or advanced streaming protocols) can be added without breaking existingfunctionality.
Reliability.
