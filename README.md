# Aritha Security
 A high-performance home surveillance video processing and streaming solution designed for seamless encoding, decoding, and real-time streaming of video content. It leverages FFmpeg,  of which is a widely-used multimedia framework, and uses advanced C++ techniques to ensure reliability and scalability. Below is a detailed high-level overview.

 ## Experience and Project. 
 In my recent project, I designed and implemented a high-performance video processing and streaming system using advanced C++ techniques and FFmpeg to enable real-time video delivery. The system was built with scalability and modularity in mind, focusing on efficient handling of video encoding, decoding, and real-time streaming protocols like RTSP. It’s engineered to ensure minimal latency, high reliability, and seamless integration with different platform.

## Challenges on the role

One of the most significant challenges was optimizing real-time streaming under varying network conditions. For example, maintaining packet integrity over RTSP in environments with intermittent bandwidth required designing a custom retry and buffering mechanism to avoid noticeable quality degradation. This was implemented using FFmpeg’s network I/O hooks.”

 ### Applications
- Live Streaming:
- Broadcasting live events (e.g., concerts, sports).
- Real-time video surveillance systems.
- Video Transcoding:
- Converting video formats (e.g., H.265 to H.264).
- Optimizing video files for web delivery.
- Edge Devices:
- Streaming from low-powered devices like IoT cameras or embedded systems.
- Media Servers:
- Integrating with media servers like GStreamer or custom-built streaming platforms.
